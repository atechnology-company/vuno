# vuno revision two

*v - vimified<br>
u - nu<br>
no - nano*

vuno is a terminal-style text editor, with people in mind.<br>

vuno is made with [sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/) and [rust](https://rust-lang.org/) through [tauri](https://tauri.app/) with <br>
codemirror, tokio, shiki, tree sitter, gemini api and tower lsp <br>

vuno is experimental right now and is missing many of the features that will be in the final release! stick around for that :))

fonts used are:
- onest
- jetbrains mono

you can sign up for a gemini api key [here](https://aistudio.google.com/) (limited free part though)
