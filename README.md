# vuno

*v - vimified<br>
u - nu<br>
no - nano*

vuno is a terminal-style text editor, with people in mind.

vuno is made with [rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and [slint](https://slint.dev/)<br>
fonts are from [jetbrains mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)

vuno is experimental right now and is missing many of the features that will be in the final release! stick around for that :))
